Moreover, painting in its traditional technique of oil on canvas, devoid of any technological innovation. Experiment is at the essence of his mode of expression. On his canvas, we can see universal processes unfurling – the forces of light and darkness collide, billow, and generate coloured structures, which fall apart and are reborn into new versions of themselves. It would be tempting to notice an interplay between art and the disciplines of physics and mathematics – the artist’s former profession – but Terekhov is against the scientific in art. He believes that art is both much wider and more precise...   \n\nIgor Terekhov began his journey into abstraction in 1975 – first with experiments in geometric abstraction, and then expressionism. Terekhov names three fellow artists among the older generation – Igor Vulokh, Marlen Spindler and Aleksei Kamenskii, all three having participated in the legendary exhibition Drugoe iskusstvo (The Other Art, 1988). Perhaps Igor Terekhov's place in the artistic landscape is somewhere close, between metaphysics and romantic abstraction, but already belonging to the eighties generation. Terekhov clearly felt that today's reality disseminated through mass media had ceased to be truly real, becoming chaos. Perhaps for this reason he turned away from visual scrutiny, and stopped seeking impressions and images in the surrounding reality. He realised the impossibility of saturating chaos with meaning by means of some description or text. Instead seeking to reach reality through intuition and inner discipline. He embarked on a journey of \"describing space\". An approach better suited than science for conveying the events of reality...\n",text_type:[{_uid:"e513598b-9bd1-4102-8277-94a854cca184",text:e,type:f,component:d}],author_name:"Anna Chudetskaya",author_position:n},{_uid:"03d892eb-094e-4e23-8936-bd02cf4dc5b9",component:c,main_text:"Igor Terekhov's painting presents a multi-dimensional space within closed structures.

But from this Chaos, from disorderly and irregular geometric forms, the viewer is invited to create their own ordered and logical world. \n\nIt’s not a bad idea – to assign divine duties to human beings.

Gingerly looking into them (will you be able to get out?), one unwittingly recalls the prayer \"Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, o Lord.\" \n\nThe artist’s intrinsic eschatological thinking expressed through his paintings, compels us to perceive the tragic outcome of existence. The philosophical support for the art of Igor Terekhov (setting aside his interest for the orient) is based largely on fundamental, universal human values – which were first raised by ancient thinkers.\n\nIt seems that the artist reflecting on the origins of human consciousness through his art is searching for a grounding that would exalt the inner world of human individuality and could thus overcome the tragedy of daily existence. Here one can almost sense a genetic link with the thought processes of the remote past. The context brings to mind the words of the anonymous first-century author who in his treatise \"On the Sublime\" posed a thesis so close to the artist’s: \"For the true sublime, by some virtue of its nature, elevates us: uplifted with a sense of proud possession, we are filled with joyful pride, as if we had ourselves produced the very thing we heard.\" \n\nTerekhov affirms the potential painting has to solve universal human problems. Through his artworks, he attempts to overcome the tragic personality decay of his era, striving to find a purifying force akin to ancient Greek catharsis. The artist’s paintings seen together are essentially the pages from a single book of images, showing us the highly charged inner world of its author. Through his visionary creations, he convincingly reaffirms the century-long existence of non-objective art; continuing a tradition born in the works of the masters of the early twentieth century.\n",text_type:[{_uid:"e93b4c56-3f2f-4d47-9c2f-9632dd553e18",text:e,type:f,component:d}],author_name:"Mikhail Krasilin",author_position:n},{_uid:"287f1157-8377-411b-aa22-2015a1e6974f",component:c,main_text:"The program set out by Wassily Kandinsky in his treatise On the Spiritual in Art was not realised; the line of spiritual abstraction broke off, with the exception of a few artists of the Paris school who came from Russia (Polyakov, Lansky, etc.). \n\nThe modern abstractionist Igor Terekhov can rightfully be regarded as one of these few. The fruits of his twenty-year-long quest for mastery in this art compel us to appreciate him as a unique figure...\n\nWe can legitimately talk of the nearly century-old path of spiritual abstraction \"from Kandinsky to Terekhov.\" For the father abstraction, his “Gothic” formula of spiritual life had two directions – forward and upward. Terekhov’s painting is rooted in an “Orthodox” direction - into greater depths, predominantly into oneself.\n\n... An engagement with the quality and meaning of his paintings necessitates a serious effort on the part of the viewer, both mental and intellectual fortitude. It is not easy to penetrate Terekhov's paintings, certainly not at first glance. Even to look at his works is at once both respite and labour. Respite – because they have a balanced composition, always fresh, saturated, and captivatingly beautiful in their colour scheme. They are truly harmonious, although this term is nowadays rarely used in contemporary art.\n\nIt is crucial to take in his works with both heart and mind, because that is how they were created. Reconciliation, the removal of contradictions between distant concepts, - this quality in his painting is a great virtue. \n\nOf course, such depth, significance and distinctiveness of painting did not come about on its own. Another factor was necessary, one corresponding to the highest of essential requirements of art. The canon – its presence is evident as the inner foundation of his art. \n",text_type:[{_uid:"1b12896c-427e-418a-8553-79056dd55144",text:e,type:f,component:d}],author_name:"Sergey Popov",author_position:"Art historian, gallery owner"},{_uid:"7d3e35f4-c119-4ad3-844c-2c36596caa2a",component:c,main_text:"De capo al fine.\n“Stable disequilibrium”\n\n1.\nPainting radiates light, and I was compelled to undertake a series of experiments in order to analyse the nature of this light. I found the teachings of the Byzantine theologian Gregory Palamas to offer a grounding for explaining the origin of this phenomenon. The luminosity and energy emanating from a painting have nothing to do with its technique or style. Rather, it is an occurrence in the soul of the artist. The transformation of personality, interacting with the emergent space. From here I began to move towards traditional religious foundations. By 1989 the period of my studies was concluded, and my independent work began to emerge.\n\nThe most developed aesthetic theory I was familiar with by that time was that of medieval Chinese poetry, painting and calligraphy as presented in the translations of the scholar Vasily Alekseyev, dedicated to the artist’s state of creative movement. However, it was based on classical Chinese philosophy where familiarity with translations is insufficient for its real understanding and serious interpretation. On the other hand, the most convincing artistic reality for me was that of Russian and Byzantine icons. But I couldn’t become an icon painter, rather than an artist for this reason alone.\n\nWhen speaking of Russian culture, what springs to mind first of all is the literature and music of the nineteenth century, and avant-garde painting of the early twentieth century. These phenomena are relatively modern, having emerged under the powerful influence of Western European examples. The intrinsic value of this period is undeniable. However, Russian cultural traditions are rooted in deeper rhythms; the picture changes considerably if we look to its origins. It seems that the only artform that has always been present, continuously developing and generating world-class works of art – is painting. Before the seventeenth century fine art existed in the form of the icon, in those days however, icons were above all a part of spiritual and liturgical life, fulfilling a multitude of additional functions, from narrative-annalistic to theological. The icon was everything. Additionally, speaking in modern terms, it was a form of avant-garde painting. The future of Russian fine art was predetermined by the works of the founding fathers of Russian icon painting. The defining personality of this Russian component of my painting is Theophanes the Greek, an artist of incredible puissance, never editing what he saw and experienced, always individual – a personality. To measure the potential of contemporary Russian art solely by the benchmarks of the avant-garde or the “Sixtiers” would mean to constrict its horizons. \n\nAs for cultural rhythms, we should remember that Russia has been both a border and a crossroads between the East and West, North and South. Russian icons were constantly subjected to a wide range of influences: from Persian miniatures to Italian painting of the time. This ability to channel other cultures' experiences has always been integral to Russian fine art, and that is one of its finest features.\n \n\n2.\n\nThe outward signs of non-objective or abstract art say little about the content of a painting. In the art of Kandinsky there are utopian constructions of anthroposophical nature, but also – powerful breakthroughs towards a real picture, unedited by mental constructs. In developed cultures the emergence of non-figurative art is inevitable. Sooner or later the endless presentations and representations of objects degenerate into repetitions.\n\nIt is possible for objects to emerge in the new painting. In the paintings of Klee, for example, they appear as vanishing phantoms on the border of a disembodied reality, which he meticulously reconstructs. I would like to retain the right to introduce objects into the space of the canvas. There were signs and symbols in my early paintings. They were zero-symbols, a technique introduced in Bunuel's early films that created the possibility for all kinds of interpretations. From this technique I moved on to interpret the painting as an environment that allows the viewer to reconstruct reality, so my task is not to achieve a final result in an image, but to find the conditions wherein a return to reality is made possible.   \n\nThe compromise between completeness and expressiveness, the problem that tormented Cézanne, disappears in this reading. Roughly speaking, my communicative task is to make the audience think for themselves, to place them in a situation of encountering a riddle – an honest, uncontrived one. I gather the kindling, and whether the viewer will find a match to light it is a matter of luck. \n\nThis question outwardly resembles the Aristotelian theory of catharsis, but only superficially. Mimetic art functioned effectively until the late Middle Ages because the individual existed in a sacral or sacralised space. The egress out of the sanctified cosmos of antiquity and the Middle Ages cancelled the aesthetics described by Aristotle. The Lives of Moses and Heraclitus was replaced by the existence of Spinoza and Hegel. \n\nAccordingly, the artist’s task in new and modern times changed significantly. Plato's golden chain between Heaven and Earth no longer warrants discussion. The link with the sacred has been lost or deliberately broken.  Attempts to create spiritually realistic art look like romantic whims. Nevertheless, the art of the Modern Era is no less significant than the works of earlier sacred art.  The emergent social reality, asserting human independence from the world of God; an existence based on the consumption of surrogates created by social conscience – posed new challenges for artists. This situation is well described by French thinkers of the second half of the twentieth century: Rancière, Lyotard, Merleau-Ponty. \n\nFor me it looks like this: the artistic field of activity lies between perception – edited by the objective, material activity of society, and consciousness that edits this perception. This sphere (Rancière calls it the “aesthetic unconscious”), this rupture in the fabric of civilization, this glaring abyss that cannot be closed by cultural or social mechanisms, is left to the artist. Anyone who aspires to experience reality, willingly or not, must be an artist. An orthodox Christian must be an artist. Breaking through the concrete walls of our \"brave new world\" demands an enormous amount of energy.\n\nMy painting also has a footing in the tangible, real environment. I moved from the construction of shimmering, radiating fragments of reality to full-scale descriptions, condensed states of total space. Now my paintings are dynamic landscapes of the giant space between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The fluctuation of this inconceivable platform of human, cultural, historical, sacred, and physical dimensions is the energetic foundation for my current painting. \"Poetry is the vibration of meaning,\" wrote Georgii Obolduev, a Russian poet of the early twentieth century. Painting, however, deals not only with meaning but also with sensory perception. How refined or grand these feelings are is up to the artist.  It is impossible to capture an \"image of the world,\" but it is possible to sense its vibration, this stable disequilibrium. \n",text_type:[{_uid:"3b802656-64d8-41a2-906c-e98475e5f2c3",text:"Artist’s Text",type:"author",component:d}],author_name:"Igor Terekhov",author_position:b}]},slug:g,full_slug:"en\u002Ftexts",sort_by_date:a,position:-30,tag_list:[],is_startpage:h,parent_id:o,meta_data:a,group_id:"b4cecca7-a9ba-4348-a52b-74f923583c63",first_published_at:"2021-11-30T15:32:14.035Z",release_id:a,lang:p,path:a,alternates:[],default_full_slug:a,translated_slugs:a},cv:1691864471,rels:[],links:[]}],fetch:{"0":{images:["https:\u002F\u002Fa.storyblok.com\u002Ff\u002F136549\u002F373x459\u002F9a862ac9f4\u002F1.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fa.storyblok.com\u002Ff\u002F136549\u002F373x459\u002F02d3b42e6a\u002F2.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fa.storyblok.com\u002Ff\u002F136549\u002F373x459\u002Fc041ce9324\u002F3.jpg"]},"1":{isOpen:h,story:{menu:{name:q,created_at:"2021-11-25T07:57:39.719Z",published_at:"2023-08-12T17:56:15.000Z",id:88000490,uuid:"118ef086-935c-4e2c-aefd-508a17cf7d76",content:{_uid:"cc7d7761-e5df-48f0-b977-3dbc444be7f5",links:[{_uid:"3986432a-4b61-4ae0-b690-7e57cd71fa93",link:{id:"df02632c-72aa-4bec-913b-1c6c6a5b6560",url:b,linktype:i,fieldtype:j,cached_url:"\u002Fen\u002Fabout",prep:k},text:"Biography",component:l},{_uid:"ccf85fbc-5f93-4026-bb10-07f24219dcc8",link:{id:"a11db849-a50e-4e69-9958-aa79a50c002c",url:b,linktype:i,fieldtype:j,cached_url:"\u002Fen\u002Fperiods",prep:k},text:"Periods",component:l},{_uid:"0aa702b6-a5da-400c-a293-2f20c36845c8",link:{id:m,url:b,linktype:i,fieldtype:j,cached_url:"\u002Fen\u002Ftexts",prep:k},text:"Texts",component:l}],component:"Menu"},slug:q,full_slug:"en\u002Fglobal\u002Fmenu",sort_by_date:a,position:o,tag_list:[],is_startpage:h,parent_id:88000488,meta_data:a,group_id:"5a352415-3835-48c3-8bbc-ccc7ba7fbd51",first_published_at:"2021-11-25T08:05:33.000Z",release_id:a,lang:p,path:a,alternates:[],default_full_slug:a,translated_slugs:a}}},"2":{email:"artiter@gmail.com",footer:{_uid:"36313a5b-e196-48e9-aaa3-e66a25b52c6c",component:"footer",copy_text:"© 2021 all rights reserved",link_text:"home"}}},mutations:[]}}(null,"","texts_items","text_type","Criticism","criticism","texts",false,"story","multilink",true,"Menu_item","a3e69427-1466-45bc-b5ec-d0f7ee0d682b","Art historian",0,"en","menu")));
